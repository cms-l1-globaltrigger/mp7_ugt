## [mp7_ugt_v1_8_1] - 2019-06-03
### Comment

- mp7_ugt firmware release v1.8.1 is created for use with IPBus builder and based on frame v1.2.3, gtl v1.7.0 and fdl v1.2.3.

### Added
- algo_pre_scaler_fractional.vhd in fdl v1.2.3 for use of floating point prescale values with precision 2
- algo_pre_scaler_fractional_pkg.vhd for mode sequence LUTs
- calo_cond_matrix.vhd, calo_cond_matrix_orm.vhd, calo_obj_cuts.vhd, muon_cond_matrix.vhd and muon_obj_cuts.vhd (Dinyar/Hannes proposal for calo quad conditions) in gtl v1.7.0
- run_simulation_questa.py to ../mp7_ugt/scripts for simulation
- run_compile_simlib.py to ../mp7_ugt/scripts for generating Vivado simulation libs for Questa
- run_simulation_algo_prescaler_fractional.py to ../mp7_ugt/firmware/sim/scripts for simulating algo_pre_scaler_fractional_tb.vhd in a loop

### Changed
- fdl_module.vhd and algo_slice.vhd for algo_pre_scaler_fractional.vhd in fdl v1.2.3
- gtl_pkg_tpl.vhd (inserted PRESCALER_FRACTION_WIDTH and types for cond_matrix) in gtl v1.7.0
- file names in gtl v1.7.0 (from now names without _vx used)
- runIpbbSynth.py for possibility of simulation

## [mp7_ugt_v1_7_0] - 2019-04-03
### Comment

- mp7_ugt firmware release v1.7.0 is created for use with IPBus builder and based on frame v1.2.3, gtl v1.6.0 and fdl v1.2.2.

### Changed
- used "FRAME_VERSION" in gt_mp7_core_pkg.vhd for mp7_ugt firmware release number.
- added ugt_strategy.tcl for ugt specific strategy and inserted it into top.dep.
- modified uGT_algo.dep: removed "doubled" commands (these commnads are in MP7 dep files).
- added scripts runIpbbSynth.py for IPBB synthesis (all 6 mp7_ugt modules), checkIpbbSynth.py and fwpackerIpbb.py.
